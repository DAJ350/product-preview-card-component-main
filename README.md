## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox

### What I learned

It wasn't really a new learning but I was reminded that percentages are great for sizing elements relative to the width of their parent elements. Using rem/em for this doesn't feel as fluid to me that using percentages.
